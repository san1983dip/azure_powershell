<## what we have done to this script is 
- command will not cache azure portal login from local system 
- we will login to the portal using "Application object" which is in tern "service principle"
- very importetn - we have to allow the "Application object" to create resources under my subscription. we can grant this as resource group level also. to achieve this 
we need to go subscription - select my targeted subscription - Access control (IAM) - Add - "Add Role Asignment" - select the role [here it's contributer] - 
select your "application object name from drop down and complete the process."
